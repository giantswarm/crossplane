                    access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                    For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                    a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                    (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                    the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                    (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only
                    to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.
