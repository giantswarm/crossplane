# the extension manager ClusterRoleBinding is to the cluster-admin ClusterRole because it needs to
# create arbitrary RBAC permissions for arbitrary extensions.  A service account cannot grant RBAC
# permissions that it doesn't already have itself, so to support the arbitrary permissions needs of
# all extensions, we are using the cluster-admin role.
#
# Note that this is scoped to just the extension manager and not to all of Crossplane (which uses a
# separate service account and role/binding).
