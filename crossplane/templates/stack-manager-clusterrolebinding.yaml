# the stack manager ClusterRoleBinding is to the cluster-admin ClusterRole because it needs to
# create arbitrary RBAC permissions for arbitrary stacks.  A service account cannot grant RBAC
# permissions that it doesn't already have itself, so to support the arbitrary permissions needs of
# all stacks, we are using the cluster-admin role.
#
# Note that this is scoped to just the stack manager and not to all of Crossplane (which uses a
# separate service account and role/binding).
